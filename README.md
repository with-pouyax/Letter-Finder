# Letter Finder


The Letter Finder is a simple JavaScript function designed to locate the position(s) of a specified letter within a given word.

### How it Works

The letterFinder function automatically checks the following conditions:

word must be a string with a length of at least 2.
match must be a string with a length of 1.
If these conditions are met, the function iterates through each character in the word and identifies the position(s) where the specified match character is found.

### Usage

To use the function, simply provide the word and match parameters. If the conditions are met, the function will output the position(s) of the specified letter in the word. If the conditions are not met, an informative message will be displayed.
